# SPI

SPI is a high‑speed, full‑duplex communication protocol used to connect a microcontroller 
(Master) with peripherals (Slaves) such as sensors, displays, ADCs, DACs, and memory chips.

### SPI Signal Lines

SPI uses four main signals:

- MOSI – Master Out, Slave In
- MISO – Master In, Slave Out
- SCK – Clock generated by the Master
- CS/SS – Chip Select / Slave Select (active low)

Only the selected device (CS = LOW) communicates.

### How to connect?

It’s not an easy question to answer in a universal way, because the best and most reliable method is 
always to check the device’s documentation. Every SPI device can have different pin names, 
voltage requirements, timing constraints, or communication commands.

At the same time, there are some general rules that usually apply:

- MOSI → MOSI (or DI)
- MISO → MISO (or DO)
- SCK → SCK
- CS → CS
- and a shared GND
