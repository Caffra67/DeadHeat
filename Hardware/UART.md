# UART

## Tools 

- Sigrok / Pulseview

This tool will help you to analize logic analyzer and oscilloscope with GUI.

## How to connect ?

At first we need to look at PCB to find where we can connect this can look like that, but its depend on PCB

Most of thing you can use as defoult,
most important is Baud rate we can change it if there is Frame error
at wikipednia we can find list for **Bit rate (bit/s)**

we need to that a mesuer

so we can see that there is 14.285714286 kHz
and like that we can check what is closes Bit rate standart
and its 14,400

you can check it for example here
